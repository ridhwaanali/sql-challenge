# sql-challenge
#my sql could not obtain the data properly because when i uploaded the csv to the database it would 
fail to obtain data from big csv such as employee, dept_emp, and salaries
i needed to upload them to the database inorder to grab the data from them in my sql.
i know i had to use sqlalchemy but i could not analyze my sql data if there is no data inside it. 
my other option was to actually INSERT VALUE for those tables but there is a lot of data in those 3 tables
